## What Is Onion Design?
Onion Design refers to the layered approach used in the game's design. Each level of the game is structured like layers of an onion, where players must peel away the challenges one by one to reach the core (the end of the level). As the player progresses, new layers (challenges) are introduced, adding complexity and depth to the gameplay. This design ensures that the game remains engaging and challenging as players advance through the levels.
