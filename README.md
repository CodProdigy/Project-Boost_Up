## What Is Onion Design?
Onion design, also referred to as onion architecture, is `a metaphorical approach to game development, likening a game to an onion with multiple layers`. Each layer represents a distinct aspect of the game, such as core gameplay, level design, story, art, or sound. This concept is inspired by the idea of peeling an onion, where each layer reveals a new, refined aspect of the game.

In game design, onion architecture `encourages developers to focus on one layer at a time, building upon the previous layer to create a cohesive and polished game`. This approach helps developers prioritize resources and avoid spreading themselves too thin across multiple areas.

### Onion Design of Project Boost
Each level of the game is structured like layers of an onion, where players must peel away the challenges one by one to reach the core (the end of the level). As the player progresses, new layers (challenges) are introduced, adding complexity and depth to the gameplay. This design ensures that the game remains engaging and challenging as players advance through the levels.
